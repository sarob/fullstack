 full stack development by AI project

## Overview
Build a full stack web application with only help from AI. Use perplexity and copilot
Publish results in a personal github repository 

## first query
I want to develop a full stack using web application typescript, node.js, react, nexus, tailwind and netlify to take data from various public sources of US deaths by violence and publish it. The repository will be initially published my github profile. I will need a low cost cloud service provider to host the web application. I am not sure if a database is needed for the web application. I will buy the facesoflife.org address. The web application data needs to be updatable by crowdsourcing either by the repository or the web interface to improve the data quality. Future versions can include using AI RAG for gathering data from private government sources, publishing specific deaths to X, and creating an iOS application to reach more eyeballs. Subscriptions will be used to fund the project past initial implementation.
